## Agenda Items

| Number |                         Item |
| :----- | ---------------------------: |
| [1]    |  Decide the theme of the APP |
| [2]    | Decide the extended features |
| [3]    |                    UI sketch |
| [4]    |  Assign tasks. specify roles |

## Meeting Minutes

- We decide to design a charity event APP(like Eventbrite), which is addressing the 17 goals of SDGs of "Make cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable". Some events may bring diverse people together to foster inclusivity, some events like raise funds to police and firefighters would make the city saferâ€¦We think this APP is not just a tool for event management, but a platform for social change and community improvement.

- For extended features, we decide to do the following:

  - Data-Profile -  Create a profile page for Users.

  - Data-GPS - To search the events within given range. i.e. from 5km - 10km

  - Data-Deletion - Delete a node from AVL Tree

  - FB-Auth - Login/Sign up users

  - FB-Persist

  - P2P-DM

  - Interact-Follow

    Extra features if time is permitted: 1. Integrate a recommended system to suggest related events that the user might be interested with. 2. Integrate a GAN model that can generate user's avatar.

- The sketched UI layouts are shown below:

  ![ui-design-2](media/Assets/ui-design-2.png)

- Roles:

  - Zhiyuan Lu, Tengkai Wang - work on databases
  - Xuan Li, Qianwen Shen - Work on information processing and interface interactions
  - Haolin Li - Searching Algorithms (include tokenizer and parser)
  
- Design pattern to use:

  - Singleton - use in Firestore database
  - Observer - use in organizer publishes notifications to followers.
  - Iterator: Iterate events information
